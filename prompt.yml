# user_request
"""
The index.html page is too long. Please, how can I split it into multiple files?
I'm constrained by client side solutions, because my server is static. The solution must split the form sections into multiple files.
I also wanna use vscode to edit the files with html, css and js syntax highlighting, so convert the html files to strings is not an ideal solution.
